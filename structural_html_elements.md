<h1 align=center>Sectioning Content</h1>

## Section
The section element is used to organize content into logical sections. These can be nested like ```div```'s. There are two guiding principles in choosing your section elements. First, sections should be topical; youâ€™re organizing content based on the material being presented. Second, sections should flow linearly. For example, the introduction flows into the first main point, and so on. The antithesis of this will be more apparent when I discuss the aside element.

## Article
Articles are used to group content that can stand on its own, such as blog posts. Article elements can be used anywhere you would use a section element, if the content is independent and reusable. An article, especially a larger one, will often use the section element to organize the article topically as I described previously. Also, an article element can include other article elements, as would be the case with a blog post including comments.
