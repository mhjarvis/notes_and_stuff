<h1 align=center>Sectioning Content</h1>

## ```<section></section>```
- organize content into logical sections
- can be nested like ```div```'s
- sections should be topical; organize content based on the material being presented
- sections should flow linearly

## ```<article></article>```
- used to group content that can stand on its own, such as blog posts
- used anywhere you would use a section element, if the content is independent and reusable
- an article element can include other article elements, as would be the case with a blog post including comments.

## ```<aside></aside>```
- used to group content that does not belong in the normal flow of your document
- examples: reference information, author information, advertising space, calendar of events, 'a side bar'

## ```<nav></nav>```
- used to group a set of links (e.g. menu)
- if the content is primarily links, put it in a nav element

## ```<address></address>```
- not included in ```section``` elements, but is used to provide contact information for either the document or a specific article
- intended for providing contact information (e.g. email, url, phone number, address, etc.)
