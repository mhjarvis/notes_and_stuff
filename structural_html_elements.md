<h1 align=center>Sectioning Content</h1>

## ```<section></section>```
- organize content into logical sections
- can be nested like ```div```'s
- sections should be topical; organize content based on the material being presented
- sections should flow linearly

## ```<article></article>```
- used to group content that can stand on its own, such as blog posts
- used anywhere you would use a section element, if the content is independent and reusable
- an article element can include other article elements, as would be the case with a blog post including comments.
