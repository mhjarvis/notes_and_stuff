<h1 align=center>Sectioning Content</h1>

## Section
The section element is used to organize content into logical sections. These can be nested like ```div```'s. There are two guiding principles in choosing your section elements. First, sections should be topical; youâ€™re organizing content based on the material being presented. Second, sections should flow linearly. For example, the introduction flows into the first main point, and so on. The antithesis of this will be more apparent when I discuss the aside element.
