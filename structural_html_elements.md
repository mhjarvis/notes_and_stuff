<h1 align=center>Sectioning Content</h1>

## Section
- organize content into logical sections
- can be nested like ```div```'s
- sections should be topical; organize content based on the material being presented
- sections should flow linearly

## Article
Articles are used to group content that can stand on its own, such as blog posts. Article elements can be used anywhere you would use a section element, if the content is independent and reusable. An article, especially a larger one, will often use the section element to organize the article topically as I described previously. Also, an article element can include other article elements, as would be the case with a blog post including comments.
